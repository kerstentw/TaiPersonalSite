As a student, I was also involved with the architecture department's interdiciplinary lab alongside Terry Boubois (reference available upon request) working to research and build digital interfaces for engineers and architects while working closely on process design with the school of business.  I also attended business clases and completed an independent study course on professional feature writing and received a scholarship to attend the Skidmore writing symposium in New York.  As an undergraduate, I also helped to found a game development club where we used C++ and Java to build modifications for popular video games at the time.  In order to mitigate student debt, I worked 3 jobs as a janitor, pressman, and pizzaboy which added a year to my schooling but prevented me from needing to tackle the challenge of student debt.",

Although I was not responsible for operations, I took on the task of organizing the first investment into the business and handled some of the structuring of the financials for the truck.  Eventually, I would move to Korea but had the opportunity to work in the truck briefly and when we sold it in 2012, had the pleasure of seeing my partners move on to greener pastures at Amazon in Seattle, Washington.
